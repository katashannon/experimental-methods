## R Markdown Practice

### 9/27/2021

Tool kit for paths relative to the project root. Here's how to call files from a dynamic directory - relatibve to the project root.

Start a project repository, associate it with an R project (new project in a new working directory). Then you can create a git repository if you want. The R studio session lives in this project root. This generally refer there so you do not need to specify root path. Can also use here() package - wjocj tries to figure out path/project root.

use here("data/foo.csv") so do not have to use ...as a directory path.

```{r example figure, fig.height=3}
hist(mtcars$mpg)
x <- 13
```

```{r}
kable(head(mtcars), digits = 1)
```

Here is some text. I would like to tell you that there are `r 10+2` months in a year. And `r x` is bigger than that number.


This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
mod <- lm(mpg ~ hp + cyl, data = mtcars)
kable(tidy(mod), digits = 3)
ts <- with(mtcars,t.test(hp[cyl==4], hp[cyl==6]))
```

Adding stats within code `r (round(ts$parameter, 2))` # this didn't work quite right

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
